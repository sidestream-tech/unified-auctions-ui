#
# ```sh
# > gh auth login
# > gh api graphql -f query='
#     query($org: String!, $number: Int!) {
#       organization(login: $org){
#         projectNext(number: $number) {
#           id
#           fields(first:20) {
#             nodes {
#               id
#               name
#               settings
#             }
#           }
#         }
#       }
#     }' -f org=sidestream-tech -F number=PROJECT_NUMBER_FROM_GITHUB_PROJECTS_URL --jq '.data.organization.projectNext.id'

#
# The `GH_WORKFLOW_TOKEN` of this flow needs the following permissions:
# - admin:org - as project boards are organization wide
# - repo - this full level is sadly required in order to manage repository issues
