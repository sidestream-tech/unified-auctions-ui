# Unified Auctions Notification Service

## What is "Unified Auctions Notification Service?"?

"Unified Auctions Notification Service" is a server-side application with the purpose of updating users to a specific
blockchain contract. Whenever a change is made to this contract the user will be informed via email or other methods.
This is to ensure quick response times, when changes were made that could break our products.

The bots can be hosted by any user, provided, they configure related environment variables. For more details, please
refer to [`Environment variables`](#environment-variables) section below.

## Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

## Environment variables

- `INFURA_PROJECT_ID`: (required) [infura](https://infura.io/) project id (can be found in: dashboard -> ethereum ->
- `ETHEREUM_NETWORK`: (optional, default `kovan`) â€“ internal network name on which the bot poll for auctions. Available
- `SMTP_*`: (required) - SMTP data for the service to send emails
    - `SMTP_HOST`: (required) - SMTP host address
    - `SMTP_PORT`: (optional) - SMTP port. Defaults to `465`
    - `SMTP_USERNAME`: (required) - SMTP username
    - `SMTP_PASSWORD`: (required) - SMTP password
    - `SMTP_EMAIL`: (optional) - The displayed address from which the email was sent. Defaults to `notification@unified-auctions.makerdao.com`
- `RECEIVERS`: (optional) - a comma-separated list of email addresses, that should receive an email when an event is
  called

Note: env variables are accessible via the `secret` command under `auction-ui/notification-service/${environment}`.

## Adding a new "Event Subscription"

In order to add a custom event subscription you need to edit the file `/constants/SUBSCRIPTIONS.ts`. Inside you will
find an array of Event Subscriptions. You can add your own with the following format:

```js
export const SUBSCRIPTIONS: EventSubscription[] = [
  {
    id: 'ChainlogUpdateVersion',
    contract: '0xdA0Ab1e0017DEbCd72Be8599041a2aa3bA7e740F',
    abi: CHAINLOG_ABI,
    eventNames: ['UpdateVersion'],
  }
]
```

- `id` - Unique identifier. Used for references in email and console logs
- `contract` - The Ethereum Address on which your Event is
- `abi` - A corresponding ABI file for the contract
- `eventNames` - An array of Event names you wish to subscribe to. Use `*` to subscribe to all

## Development Setup

Please see [this centralized guide](https://github.com/sidestream-tech/guides/blob/main/frontend-development/README.md)
to get started with your development setup. Namely, you should:

- have a minimum `node` and `npm` version (see `package.json` `engine` section)
- have a certain formatting and linting setup
- don't forget to create `./notification-service/.env` file

Help on both things is given in the linked resources above.

In addition to this please be aware of the following for this project:
- By default, this project uses [Etheral Email](https://ethereal.email/) to mock emails. If Etheral is down and no custom SMTP server is set, the service will not run.
- We advise using [MailTrap](https://mailtrap.io/) for more extensive testing.
